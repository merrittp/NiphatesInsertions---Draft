\section{Discussion}
The primary finding from the sequencing of these two genomes is the novel presence of inverted repeats and insertions in the \emph{Niphates erecta} genome. These features are seen only in \emph{N. erecta} despite the close phylogenetic relationship to \emph{Niphates digitalis}. This indicates that the insertions are either newly gained in \emph{N. erecta} or newly lost in \emph{N. digitalis}. Sequencing additional \emph{Niphates} sponges might be useful in identifying the mode of acquisition.
